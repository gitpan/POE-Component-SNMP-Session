Revision history for POE-Component-SNMP-Session

        Fixed the tests... they were broken if there wasn't a proper
        config, which is unreasonable... it should quietly do nothing.
        It does that now.  Also updated the docs with a few extra
        examples.

        Updated docs.  Added a couple of examples, and corrected the
        type names returned to query callbacks.  Also updated the
        LICENSE in Makefile.PL... love those Kwalitee points!
