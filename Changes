Revision history for POE-Component-SNMP-Session

0.1202  Fri Dec 11 17:38:15 PST 2009
        Documentation cleanups.

        Altered 00-load.t to return at least ONE "ok", so smoke tests
        can have something positive to report, eg "all tests pass."

        So it seems I left reference to 'YAML' in 2 of the tests, and
        while it's installed automatically these days by CPAN,
        apparently some smoke testers don't include it in their
        sandbox. <sigh>

        Updated the tests AGAIN, bumping the version number to have
        more digits for small subreleases.  Now, SNMP.pm is *not* a
        listed requirement, as it can *not* be auto-installed from
        CPAN.  So the tests "pass" by not running anything at all in
        an automated setting.  It's cheesy but it works.

        Fixed the tests... they were broken if there wasn't a proper
        config, which is unreasonable... it should quietly do nothing.
        It does that now.  Also updated the docs with a few extra
        examples.

        Updated docs.  Added a couple of examples, and corrected the
        type names returned to query callbacks.  Also updated the
        LICENSE in Makefile.PL... love those Kwalitee points!

        Had left behind references to Spiffy.pm for debugging
        purposes.  Oops.
